# Clarification: Number of Languages Per Student

## Apology

I apologize for the confusion in the original `REST-MULTI-LANGUAGE.md` document. Some wording was unclear about how many servers each team member needs to implement.

## Clear Requirements

**Each team member must implement exactly ONE server in ONE language.**

- **Individual requirement**: 1 server per person
- **Team result**: A team of 3 people will have 3 new language servers (plus the TypeScript and Python servers already provided)

## Example

**Team of 3 students:**
- Student A: Implements Go server = 1 server
- Student B: Implements C# server = 1 server  
- Student C: Implements Ruby server = 1 server
- **Total**: 3 new servers for the team

## Grading

- Each team member earns **10 points** for successfully implementing their one server
- The team's total is **n Ã— 10 points** (where n = number of team members)
- This is normalized to 100 for Canvas
