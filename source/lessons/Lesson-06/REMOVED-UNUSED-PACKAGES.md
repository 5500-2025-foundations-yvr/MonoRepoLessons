# SQLite Package Removal - Fix for Installation Issues

## What Was Changed

We removed three unused SQLite packages that were causing installation problems:
- `better-sqlite3`
- `sqlite`
- `sqlite3`
- `@types/better-sqlite3`
- `@types/sqlite3`

**Important:** The servers do NOT use SQLite - they use in-memory storage. These packages were included by mistake and were causing:
- Installation failures (especially on Windows)
- Native build errors
- Version conflicts
- Cross-platform compatibility issues

## If You Already Cloned the Original Repository

Simply pull the latest changes:

```bash
git pull origin main
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

## If You Have This Issue in Your Team's GitHub Repository

Follow these steps to fix it in your team's fork:

### Step 1: Update package.json

Edit your `package.json` file and remove these lines from the `dependencies` section:

```json
"@types/better-sqlite3": "^7.6.11",
"@types/sqlite3": "^3.1.11",
"better-sqlite3": "^11.3.0",
"sqlite": "^5.1.1",
"sqlite3": "^5.1.7",
```

### Step 2: Clean Install

```bash
# Remove old node_modules and lock file
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Fresh install
npm install
```

### Step 3: Verify Everything Works

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, start the TypeScript server
ts-node src/servers/ts-server/server.ts
```

### Step 4: Commit and Push

```bash
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Remove unused SQLite packages that were causing installation issues"
git push
```

### Step 5: Team Members Should Update

Have your team members pull the changes:

```bash
git pull
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Windows Users
If you still have issues after following the steps above:
- Make sure you're using a recent version of Node.js (v18 or later)
- Try running your terminal as Administrator
- If problems persist, delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` again and reinstall

### Mac Users
If you have issues:
- Make sure Xcode Command Line Tools are installed: `xcode-select --install`
- Try clearing the npm cache again: `npm cache clean --force`

## Questions?

If you continue to have installation problems after following these steps, please:
1. Post the error message in the course discussion board
2. Include your OS and Node version (`node --version`)
3. Include the full error output
